# Frontend Keepalive Solution - Automatic Backend Wake-Up

## Problem
The backend on Render's free tier was going to sleep after inactivity, causing database operations to fail. Manually hitting the health endpoint (`/api/health/detailed`) would wake it up, but this required manual intervention.

## Solution
Added an automatic keepalive service in the frontend that periodically pings the backend health endpoint to keep it awake. This ensures the backend never goes to sleep as long as the frontend is being accessed.

## Implementation

### 1. BackendKeepaliveService
**File**: `frontend/src/app/core/backend-keepalive.service.ts`

- Automatically pings `/api/health/detailed` every 2 minutes (120 seconds)
- Starts automatically when the frontend application loads
- Logs success/failure in console for monitoring
- Handles errors gracefully without breaking the app

### 2. AppComponent Integration
**File**: `frontend/src/app/app.component.ts`

- Initializes the keepalive service on app startup
- Runs automatically in the background
- Requires no user interaction

## How It Works

1. **On Frontend Load**: The keepalive service starts automatically
2. **Every 2 Minutes**: Frontend pings backend health endpoint
3. **Backend Stays Awake**: Render keeps the backend active due to incoming requests
4. **Database Remains Active**: Backend's health monitor keeps database connections alive
5. **Seamless Operation**: All database operations work without manual intervention

## Benefits

✅ **Automatic**: No manual intervention required
✅ **Transparent**: Works silently in the background
✅ **Reliable**: Pings every 2 minutes (well before Render's 15-minute sleep threshold)
✅ **Non-Intrusive**: Doesn't interfere with user experience
✅ **Cost-Effective**: Works on Render's free tier

## Technical Details

- **Ping Interval**: 120 seconds (2 minutes)
- **Render Sleep Threshold**: ~15 minutes of inactivity
- **Safety Margin**: 7.5x the ping interval (very safe)
- **Endpoint**: `/api/health/detailed` (also validates database connection)

## User Experience

Users don't need to:
- Manually refresh pages
- Manually visit health endpoints
- Wait for backend to wake up
- Experience database failures

The frontend automatically keeps everything alive as long as:
- The frontend application is loaded in a browser tab
- Users are actively using the website

## Monitoring

The service logs to browser console:
- Success: `[timestamp] Backend keepalive: Success - Database: CONNECTED`
- Failure: `[timestamp] Backend keepalive: Failed - [error message]`

Check browser console (F12 → Console) to verify keepalive is working.

## Combined Solution

This frontend keepalive works together with the backend database fixes:

1. **Backend**: Database health monitor (30-second pings) + connection pool optimization
2. **Frontend**: Backend keepalive (2-minute pings) to prevent Render sleep

Together, these ensure:
- Backend stays awake (frontend keepalive)
- Database connections stay active (backend health monitor)
- Connection pool optimized for cloud deployment

## Notes

- The keepalive only runs when the frontend is loaded
- If the frontend is closed for extended periods, backend may still sleep
- This is expected behavior on Render's free tier
- First request after sleep may take a few seconds to wake the backend
