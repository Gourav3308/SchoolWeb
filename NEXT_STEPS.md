# Next Steps - Testing Your Application

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Verify Database & Collection in MongoDB Atlas

1. **Go to MongoDB Atlas Dashboard**
   - Click on "Browse Collections" in the left sidebar
   - If you see `schoolweb_db` database with `students` collection, you're done!
   - If not, click "Create Database":
     - Database Name: `schoolweb_db`
     - Collection Name: `students`
     - Click "Create"

## üöÄ Step 2: Start the Backend Server

Open a **new terminal/command prompt** and run:

```bash
cd C:\Users\goura\OneDrive\Desktop\schoolweb\backend
mvn spring-boot:run
```

**Wait for:**
- "Started SchoolwebBackendApplication" message
- Server running on port 8080
- No MongoDB connection errors

**If you see connection errors:**
- Check if your IP address is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas
- Verify the password in `application.properties` is correct
- Make sure there are no special characters in the password that need URL encoding

## üåê Step 3: Start the Frontend Server

Open **another terminal/command prompt** and run:

```bash
cd C:\Users\goura\OneDrive\Desktop\schoolweb\frontend
npm start
```

**Wait for:**
- Angular dev server to start
- Browser opens automatically at `http://localhost:4200`
- No compilation errors

## ‚úÖ Step 4: Test the Application

### Test 1: Submit Admission Form
1. Go to `http://localhost:4200/admissions` (or click "Apply Now" button)
